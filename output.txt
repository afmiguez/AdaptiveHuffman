I am happy to join with you today in what will go down in history as the greatest demonstration for 
freedom in the history of our nation. 
Five score years ago, a great American, in whose symbolic sha
dow we stand today, signed the Emancipation Proclamation. This momentous decree came as a great beac
on of hope to millions of Negro slaves, who had been seared in the flames of withering injustice. It
 came as a joyous daybreak to end the long night of their captivity. But one hundred years later, th
e Negro is still not free. One hundred years later, the life of the Negro is still sadly crippled by
 the manacle of segregation and the chains of discrimination. 

One hundred years later, the Negro l
ives on a lonely island of poverty in the midst of a vast ocean of material prosperity. One hundred 
years later, the Negro is still languishing in the corners of American society and finds himself an 
exile in his own land So we have come here today to dramatize a shameful condition. 

In a sense we 
have come to our Nation's Capital to cash a check. When the architects of our great republic wrote t
he magnificent words of the Constitution and the Declaration of Independence, they were signing a pr
omissory note to which every American was to fall heir. 

This note was a promise that all men, yes,
 black men as well as white men, would be guaranteed to the inalienable rights of life liberty and t
he pursuit of happiness. 

It is obvious today that America has defaulted on this promissory note in
sofar as her citizens of color are concerned. Instead of honoring this sacred obligation, America ha
s given the Negro people a bad check, a check that has come back marked "insufficient funds." 

But 
we refuse to believe that the bank of justice is bankrupt. We refuse to believe that there are insuf
ficient funds in the great vaults of opportunity of this nation. So we have come to cash this check,
 a check that will give us upon demand the riches of freedom and security of justice. 

We have also
 come to this hallowed spot to remind America of the fierce urgency of Now. This is not time to enga
ge in the luxury of cooling off or to take the tranquilizing drug of gradualism. 

Now is the time t
o make real the promise of democracy. 

Now is the time to rise from the dark and desolate valley of
 segregation to the sunlit path of racial justice. 

Now is the time to lift our nation from the qui
cksands of racial injustice to the solid rock of brotherhood. 

Now is the time to make justice a re
ality to all of God's children. 

It would be fatal for the nation to overlook the urgency of the mo
ment and to underestimate the determination of it's colored citizens. This sweltering summer of the 
Negro's legitimate discontent will not pass until there is an invigorating autumn of freedom and equ
ality. Nineteen sixty-three is not an end but a beginning. Those who hope that the Negro needed to b
low off steam and will now be content will have a rude awakening if the nation returns to business a
s usual. 

There will be neither rest nor tranquility in America until the Negro is granted his citi
zenship rights. The whirlwinds of revolt will continue to shake the foundations of our nation until 
the bright day of justice emerges. 

But there is something that I must say to my people who stand o
n the warm threshold which leads into the palace of justice. In the process of gaining our rightful 
place we must not be guilty of wrongful deeds. 

Let us not seek to satisfy our thirst for freedom b
y drinking from the cup of bitterness and hatred. We must ever conduct our struggle on the high plan
e of dignity and discipline. We must not allow our creative protest to degenerate into physical viol
ence. Again and again we must rise to the majestic heights of meeting physical force with soul force
. 

The marvelous new militancy which has engulfed the Negro community must not lead us to a distrus
t of all white people, for many of our white brothers, as evidenced by their presence here today, ha
ve come to realize that their destiny is tied up with our destiny. They have come to realize that th
eir freedom is inextricably bound to our freedom. We cannot walk alone. 

And as we walk, we must ma
ke the pledge that we shall always march ahead. We cannot turn back. There are those who are asking 
the devotees of civil rights, "When will you be satisfied?" We can never be satisfied as long as the
 Negro is the victim of the unspeakable horrors of police brutality. 

We can never be satisfied as 
long as our bodies, heavy with the fatigue of travel, cannot gain lodging in the motels of the highw
ays and the hotels of the cities. 

We cannot be satisfied as long as the Negro's basic mobility is 
from a smaller ghetto to a larger one. 

We can never be satisfied as long as our children are strip
ped of their selfhood and robbed of their dignity by signs stating "for white only." 

We cannot be 
satisfied as long as a Negro in Mississippi cannot vote and a Negro in New York believes he has noth
ing for which to vote. 

No, no we are not satisfied and we will not be satisfied until justice roll
s down like waters and righteousness like a mighty stream. 

I am not unmindful that some of you hav
e come here out of your trials and tribulations. Some of you have come fresh from narrow jail cells.
 Some of you have come from areas where your quest for freedom left you battered by storms of persec
utions and staggered by the winds of police brutality. 

You have been the veterans of creative suff
ering. Continue to work with the faith that unearned suffering is redemptive. 

Go back to Mississip
pi, go back to Alabama, go back to South Carolina go back to Georgia, go back to Louisiana, go back 
to the slums and ghettos of our modern cities, knowing that somehow this situation can and will be c
hanged. 

Let us not wallow in the valley of despair. I say to you today, my friends, that even thou
gh we face the difficulties of today and tomorrow. I still have a dream. It is a dream deeply rooted
 in the American dream. 

I have a dream that one day this nation will rise up and live out the true
 meaning of its creed. We hold these truths to be self-evident that all men are created equal. 

I h
ave a dream that one day on the red hills of Georgia the sons of former slaves and the sons of forme
r slave owners will be able to sit down together at the table of brotherhood. 

I have a dream that 
one day even the state of Mississippi, a state sweltering with the heat of oppression, will be trans
formed into an oasis of freedom and justice. 

I have a dream that my four little children will one 
day live in a nation where they will not be judged by the color of their skin but by the content of 
their character. 

I have a dream today. 

I have a dream that one day down in Alabama, with its vic
ious racists, with its governor having his lips dripping with the words of interposition and nullifi
cation; that one day right down in Alabama little black boys and black girls will be able to join ha
nds with little white boys and white girls as sisters and brothers. 

I have a dream today. 

I have
 a dream that one day every valley shall be exalted, and every hill and every mountain shall be made
 low, the rough places will be made plains and the crooked places will be made straight and the glor
y of the Lord shall be revealed and all flesh shall see it together. 

This is our hope. This is the
 faith that I will go back to the South with. With this faith we will be able to hew out of the moun
tain of despair a stone of hope. 

With this faith we will be able to transform the jangling discord
s of our nation into a beautiful symphony of brotherhood. 

With this faith we will be able to work 
together, to pray together, to struggle together, to go to jail together, to climb up for freedom to
gether, knowing that we will be free one day. 

This will be the day when all of God's children will
 be able to sing with new meaning "My country 'tis of thee, sweet land of liberty, of thee I sing. L
and where my fathers died, land of the Pilgrim's pride, from every mountainside, let freedom ring!" 


And if America is to be a great nation, this must become true. So let freedom ring from the hillto
ps of New Hampshire. Let freedom ring from the mighty mountains of New York. 

Let freedom ring from
 the heightening Alleghenies of Pennsylvania. 

Let freedom ring from the snow-capped Rockies of Col
orado. 

Let freedom ring from the curvaceous slopes of California. 

But not only that, let freedom
, ring from Stone Mountain of Georgia. 

Let freedom ring from every hill and molehill of Mississipp
i and every mountainside. 

And when this happens, when we let freedom ring, when we let it ring fro
m every tenement and every hamlet, from every state and every city, we will be able to speed up that
 day when all of God's children, black men and white men, Jews and Gentiles, Protestants and Catholi
cs, will be able to join hands and sing in the words of the old spiritual, "Free at last, free at la
st. Thank God Almighty, we are free at last."
